Insertions
  MILS
    5.5, 6.5, 6.9, 7.7
    spiral of tillaux

Principles
  lateral and medial orbital walls are at 45˚
    orbital axis is therefore 22.5˚ to either wall, usually simplified to 23˚
    in primary gaze, visual axis is 23˚ with orbital axis
    EOM action depends on globe position at time of contraction
  primary action
    muscle effect when in primary position
  subsidiary action
    additional effects depending on position of eye
  listing plane
    imaginary coronal plane passing through the globes centre of rotation
  axes of Fick
    X
      horisontal
      globe rotates up and down
    Y
      sagittal
      torsional movements
        intorsion when superior limbus rotates nasally, extorsion on temporal rotation
    Z
      vertical
      globe rotates left and right

Medial and lateral rectus
  muscles in horisontal plane
    muscle contractions rotate eye around vertical axis
      adduction and abduction
  pulleys
    sleeves of connective tissue which the muscles pass through a little posterior to insertion points on eye
    attached to wall of orbit
    positions of muscles therefore constrained in same line
      principle effect of medial and lateal muscle remains same in sup and inf gase

Superior and inferior rectus and obliques
  axis of orbit deviated 23 degrees laterally from visual axis
    results in a primary and secondary action for these muscles
