anatomy
  Oculomotor nucleus
    midbrain at level of superior colliculus
  EW nucleus preganglionic parasympathetic fibres travel with
  Exit at medial aspect of crus cerebri, within the interpeduncular fossae
  Passes between posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar a.
  Anterior course, in wall of cavernous sinus
  Superior orbital fissure
  Oculormotor nerve innervation
    superior devision
      superior rectus, levator palpabre superioris
    inferior devision
      inferior oblique, inferior rectus, medial rectus
  Preganglionic fibres from EW terminate at ciliary ganglion
    Short ciliary n carry post ganglionic fibres
    Sphincter pupillae

ocular manifestations
  complete third nerve palsy
    complete ipsilateral ptosis, hypotropia, exotropia, dilated pupil
  partial third nerve palsy
    any of the above to varying degrees
    pupil involving vs pupil sparing

causes
  compression
    aneurysm, SOL, raised ICP
  ischemia
    diabetes, GCA, HTN, atherosclerosis
  inflammation
    MS, infection
  trauma
  congenital
    children, rare, unilateral, no other neuro abnormalities

  Pupil involving vs pupil sparing
    if pupil sparing and complete CNIII, pt>50, risk factors, can presume vasculopathic CNII palsy
      aneurysms not involving pupil in early stage described so need to follow pt closesly
    if pupil involving
      exclude aneurysm
