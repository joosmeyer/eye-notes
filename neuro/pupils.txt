Pupillary function testing
  Pupil function itself
  Afferent visual system
  Autonomic innervation of the eye

Pupillary light reflex anatomy
  afferent
    ganglion cell axons to pretectal area of midbrain
    interneurons to EW
    2 sites of fibre decussation
      optic chiasm
      midbrain interneurons
  efferent
    EW neuron axons to ipsilateral ciliary ganglion
      travel CNIII
    ciliary ganglion to pupillary sphincter
      post ganglionic parasympathetic fibers
      short posterior ciliary nerve
    bilateral sharing of neural input
      afferents pre EW cannot cause anisocoria!
      anisocoria always a sign of efferent pupillary disorder

RAPD
  evidence of an asymmetrical optic neuropathy
    unilateral optic neuropathy
    bilateral asymmetrical optic neuropathy
    symmetrical optic neuropathy will not produce RAPD
  elicited by the swinging flashlight test
    alternating monocular light stimulus
      first eye illumination
        pupil constriction
      transfer
        both pupils dilate
        the slower the transfer the greater the dilation
      contralateral arrival
        pupil constriction again
          observe speed and extent
          compare to other side
            if weaker constriction or dilation on arrival (pupillary escape)
              RAPD
            if consensual response > direct response
              ipsilateral optic nerve deficit
            if direct response > consensual response
              contralateral optic nerve deficit
            if one pupil does not react to light or if there is significant anisocoria
              focus attention on better reacting pupil and use above two rules
            if both pupils do not react to light
              test cannot be used
    sources of error
      variation in distance and angle of illumination (one eye vs other)
      variation in time spent on one eye vs other
      stimulus too bright or dim
        if too bright subtle RAPD will be missed as pupillary sphincter will always reach maximal constriction
      changes in patient fixation / accommodation during examination.

DDx of RAPD
  dense VH
    optical defect in refractive media of eye never produces RAPD with this exception
  macular disease
    only when damage is severe and strongly asymmetrical
  unilateral optic neuropathy
    always
  bilateral optic neuropathy
    only when asymmetrical
  chiasmal disease
    frequently
  optic tract disease
    nearly always
    contralateral to the affected side
  retrogeniculate disease
    sometimes
      developmental abnormalities of cerebral hemisphere associated with trans synaptic degeneration at LGN
    contralateral to affected side
  amblyopia
    rare
  uncovering of the eye
    bandage, lid
    transient, contralateral, secondary to differing levels of dark adaptation that quickly equilibrate

Anisocoria
  Which is the the problem pupil? light reactivity
    if one pupil is poorly reactive
      that is the problematic pupil
    if both pupils are reactive
      measure pupillary diameter in light and dark conditions
        greater difference in the dark
          smaller pupil is abnormal
            can't dilate
            subtle cases may show a dilation lag instead
              when you dim the lights
                anisocoria @ 5 seconds > anisocoria @ 15 seconds
        greater difference in the light
          larger pupil is abnormal
            can't constrict
            subtle cases may show a constriction lag instead
              when you turn on the lights
                anisocoria @ 5 seconds > anisocoria @ 15 seconds
            8+ mm should make you think pharmacologic
              CN3P dilation is not usually this large
  Is there an RAPD?
    severity
      dilates as soon as you swing to that side
      dilates after a pause
      constricts but settles at a larger size than the fellow eye
  Is the near reflex normal?
    light near dissociation
      dorsal midbrain syndrome
      advanced syphilis
      not pathognomonic
        can be seen in
          optic neuropathy
          advanced retinopathy
  be systematic
    measurements in light
    measurements in dark
    direct
    consensual
    swinging
      RAPD?
    near reflex
      make sure you start them on a distant target and then switch
  Is there sectoral weakness?
    typical of an Adie tonic pupil
      results in vermiform movements on attempted constriction
  Is there iris atrophy?
    uveitis
      HSV
      VZV
    ischemia
  Does the patient have a headache?
    young patient with a thunderclap HA and poorly reactive dilated pupil
      aneurysm until proven otherwise
  Are the lids and motility normal?
    Savino rule
      when confronted with an abnormality of 1 of these 3 things
        lids
        pupil
        motility
      ALWAYS: check the other 2
      this way you won't miss CN3P, Horner, etc.
  Is the rest of the eye exam normal?
    there are many causes of an RAPD
  Is the rest of the neurologic exam normal?

DDx anisocoria
  physiologic
    1/5 of normal patients if you look for it
  RAPD due to ocular disease
  CN3P // see ptosis.txt & HT-vertical-strabismus.txt
  Horner // see ptosis.txt
  PS 2Ëš inflammation
  Adie tonic pupil
    local ciliary ganglion or short ciliary nerve damage
    vermiform sectoral weakness
    denervation hypersensitivity to dilute 0.1% pilocarpine
    despite sluggish pupil response in the light
      near response is usually normal
      blurry when they switch back to distance
        but they slowly adjust
  ischemia
    anterior segment ischemia
    ACG
  pharmacologic
    do all of your other testing before instilling agents to test this
      e.g. you need to test dilute pilo for Adie before testing full strength
  trauma
    sphincter tears
